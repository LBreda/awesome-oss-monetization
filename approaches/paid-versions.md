# Monetization via Paid Versions
AKA: Crowdfunding, Pre-order

Proposals from maintainers to develop major features or new versions of the software. Payments are collected via a crowdfunding platform in various tiers and can offer additional countervalues (e.g., naming the version).
Often these are one-time payments for one version, but can be repeated if the community support exists (e.g., for every minor version).

Requires:
* Setup of project description and payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Description of the proposed project and description of benefits
* "Marketing activites" to inform and motivate users to pay for the project

Variants & Options:
* Single Project: Development of a new version or major feature
* Recurring Projects: Development of minor versions or features (e.g., quarterly or on demand)

## Platforms
* [Kickstarter](https://issuehunt.io/)
* [IndieGoGo](https://www.indiegogo.com/)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Days   | Some descriptions and bank info is sufficient
| Effort to maintain                | Medium | New description for every new version & development time
| Cost to set-up                    | Low    | Maybe some costs for making a great video / demo of the future version
| Cost to maintain                  | None   | No cost after if funding goal is reached. But process is repeatable with next version
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Can work for larger versions
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Depends on community size & will to fund
| Income Predictability             | Low    | Depends on the extensibility of the software (plugins could work better)
| Full income Threshold             | 100+   | 
| Recipient                         | C      | Might be only a sub-group who develop the tools, etc.
| Additional Work                   | Low    | New version is probably already on the roadmap
| Visibility                        | Low    | Easy to forget, ignore, or overlook by users
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Voluntary
| Entry Threshold                   | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Countervalue                      | Work   | 
| Scalability                       | Low    | Scales to the time available to develop new version
| Effort for marketing              | High   | 
| Competitors                       | None   | 
| Software types                    | Progs  | Harder for Libraries; Easier for Programs, Tools, Databases, etc.
