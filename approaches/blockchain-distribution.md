# Monetization via Blockchain Distibution

Contributions made by a user to the OSS project by downloading it with a blockchain-based package manager. Will lead to recurring payments - currently in form of crypto tokens that need to be converted into real money.

Requires:
* Package manager that is able to register and distribute OSS (e.g., a MacOS application)
* Might require additional mechanism to convert crypto tokens into money

Variants & Options:
* Download-based: Tokens are distributed based on downloads
* Sponsor-based: Tokens can be bought by users and gifted (or used to "pay" for downloads)

## Platforms
* [tea.xyz](https://tea.xyz/) (Blockchain-based package manager; see also their [Whitepaper](https://tea.xyz/tea.white-paper.pdf))

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Hours  | Registering at the blockchain-based package manager
| Effort to maintain                | Low    | Probably only uploading or registering new versions
| Cost to set-up                    | None   | 
| Cost to maintain                  | None   | 
| One-time Income                   | N/A    | Token system probably causes recurring revenue
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Crypto might not be worth much; Depends on need to buy tokens
| Income Predictability             | Medium | If users accept paying it should become stable; Crypto might be very volatile
| Full income Threshold             | ?1000+ | Depends heavily on pricing of the crypto token
| Recipient                         | I or C | 
| Additional Work                   | None   | Maybe little extra work to deploy to blockchain registry
| Visibility                        | Medium | Might be visible if users need to buy tokens to download
| Necessity to pay                  | High   | Payment is enforced by using the package manager
| Entry Threshold                   | None   | Client only pays indirectly via his hoster/cloud for the resources
| Countervalue                      | OSS    | User pays for downloading & using the OSS
| Scalability                       | High   | Scales with the number of users
| Effort for marketing              | None   | Will make waves but no "sale" is necessary
| Competitors                       | None   | 
| Software types                    | Special| Best for tools and libraries
