# Monetization via Grants and Stipends

Contributions made from institutions, funds, companies, foundations, or organizations to individual maintainers, contributors, or OSS projects. Often these are large or recurring payments to enable quasi-salaries that do not require repayment.

Requires:
* Application for grant or stipend 
* Setup of a payment receiver (might require incorporation / freelancing or fiscal host)
* Recurring "documentation activites" to document the use of the funding

Variants & Options:
* Single grant: One-time contribution
* Recurring grant: Monthly recurring contributions

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Weeks  | Applications often require longer descriptions and impact analysis
| Effort to maintain                | Medium | Often runs automatical for several month
| Cost to set-up                    | None   | 
| Cost to maintain                  | None   | 
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Can encompass several person-month for salaries
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Often runs for several month but very hard to renew for a second period
| Income Predictability             | Low    | Stable for several months but very hard to renew or find another grant
| Full income Threshold             | 1+     | 
| Recipient                         | I + C  | Often specific for a person but can go to a legal entity
