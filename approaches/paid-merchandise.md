# Monetization via Paid Merchandise
AKA: Accessorizing

Payments for merchandise, swag, apparel, mugs, stickers, books, NFTs, or other content created by the maintainers. Often one-time payments without many recurring options.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Creation of the content (might include payment for designers) 

Variants & Options:
* Logo-only Merchandise: Often only the logo and maybe a funny slogan is sufficient.
* Books: Publishing shorter texts as eBooks or larger text for paper books is more time-consuming but with higher earnings

## Platforms

* [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) (Paper Books)
