# Monetization by Paid Content
AKA: Pay for Data, Virtual Goods, Service Enabler

While the OSS is free of cost, the content or data presented or used in it is sold. Content can be, for example, news feeds, stock ticker, virtual goods, designs, clipart, etc. Often leads to recurring payments for data streams but can also be a singular payment for content.

Requires:
* Setup of a data / content hosting platform (hosted of self-hosted)
* Integration of payment mechanism
* Setup of a legal entity to accept the payments

Variants & Options:
* Freemium Data: A useful portion of content is free but premium content / data can be bought.
* In-Stream Advertisements: A content stream is "enriched" with ads, which can be turned off for a fee.
* Revenue Share: Data to be paid is provided by a third-party, but an integration is supported and the third party pays for it (e.g., maintainers get some percentage / kickback of what users pay)
* Data resale: Data to be paid is bought from a third-party and resold to the users with a margin
