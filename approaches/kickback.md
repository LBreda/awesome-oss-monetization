# Monetization via Kickback from Hoster
AKA: Paid by Hoster

Unconcious contributions made by a user to the OSS project via a hoster / cloud that supports kickback. Payout can be in form of credits but might potentially be resellable or convertible via value generating systems (e.g. a crypto miner). If the OSS runs for a longer time this can generate recurring revenue.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (receiving payments or resell credits)
* Registration for the kickback mechanism (each hoster/cloud)
* Might require setup of a value-generating algorithm (e.g., CryptoMiner to convert credits into money)

Variants & Options:
* Credits-based: Maintainers get a share of the credits the users pay on the hoster's platform
* Money-based: Maintainers get a direct payout

## Platforms
* [Railway](https://railway.app/open-source-kickback) (Credits for installed OSS)

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Weeks  | Application to be approved by a hoster; Might need extra work to convert credits into real money
| Effort to maintain                | Low    | 
| Cost to set-up                    | None   | 
| Cost to maintain                  | Low    | Maybe a little work to use or exchange the credits
| One-time Income                   | N/A    | 
| Recurring Income                  | Low    | Depends on the payout offered or the effectiveness to convert credits into money
| Income Predictability             | Medium | If the clients like the hoster payouts can be stable
| Full income Threshold             | ?1000+ | Depends heavily on efficiency of the value-generating subsystem
| Recipient                         | C      | 
| Additional Work                   | None   | 
| Visibility                        | N/A    | Not necessary but might help hoster
| Necessity to pay                  | Low    | Payment is collected by hoster (who might have higher prices)
| Entry Threshold                   | None   | Client only pay indirectly via his hoster/cloud for the resources
| Countervalue                      | Aware. | Users get nothing but hosters get awareness
| Scalability                       | Medium | Scales with the number of running instances (but only at few hosters)
| Effort for marketing              | Low    | It might help to nudge users towards the hoster
| Competitors                       | None   | 
| Software types                    | Special| Best for stand-alone systems on one server (e.g., databases, blogs, LMS, etc.)
