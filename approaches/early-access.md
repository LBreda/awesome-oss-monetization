# Monetization via Early Access
AKA: Sponsorware, Embargo model, "Unlock the commons", Delayed open-sourcing

Contributions made from private persons or companies to individual maintainers, contributors, or OSS projects in order to get early access to code, apis, documentation, etc. These are often semi-recurring payments for every new version.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (hosted or self-build)
* Collection and description of one or more tiers / offerings

Variants & Options:
* Single payments for version- / result-specific early access
* Recurring payments for continuous access to "closed repository"
* Tiered Access Levels: Offering access to different maturity-levels or types (code, api, docu, ...)
* [Sponsorware](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs)
* [Embargo Model](https://lwn.net/Articles/786068/) as defined by Heather Meeker: sell access to code before it is publicly released (either to beta versions or even full final versions)
* ["Unlocking the commons"](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/01/unlocking-the-commons/) as defined by Tim Carmondy: Giving access to early previews and experiments

## Platforms
* [Github Sponsors-only repositories](https://github.blog/2022-02-02-new-sponsors-only-repositories-custom-amounts-and-more/)
* [Memberspace](https://www.memberspace.com/) (giving access to (parts of) a website)
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) etc. (giving manual access to repos)

## Evaluation

| Characteristics                   | Value  | Note |
| --------------------------------- |:------ |:---- |
| Effort to set-up                  | Hours  | Only requires private repository or password-protected website
| Effort to maintain                | High   | Constant reminders to sponsor necessary; Requires additional "publish" step
| Cost to set-up                    | Low    | Might require a little money for hosting private repos/content 
| Cost to maintain                  | Low    | Might require a little money for hosting private repos/content 
| One-time Income                   | Medium | Often based on hourly wage
| Recurring Income                  | Medium | Few users wants early access but might pay more and recurring if so
| Income Predictability             | Medium | If recurring payments work they will probably continue  
| Full income Threshold             | 100+   | 
| Recipient                         | C      | 
| Additional Work                   | Low    | Might require to manage public and private repos/content
| Visibility                        | Medium | Easy to forget, ignore, or overlook, but early-access users might talk about the new stuff
| Necessity to pay                  | Medium | Might be necessary for security-sensitive companies or hosting services (e.g., for databases)
| Entry Threshold                   | Low    | Credit card is sufficient
| Countervalue                      | Access | Might cause minimal additional work to handle multiple repositories
| Scalability                       | Low    | Early access to OSS gives only rarely an edge
| Effort for marketing              | Medium | Similar to donations but early-access users might talk about the new stuff
| Competitors                       | None   | 
| Software types                    | All    | Esp. for OSS that gives payer an edge (test security, write news, host service, ...)
