# Monetization via Paid Hosting
AKA: Open SaaS

The open-source software (e.g., a database or blogging system) is hosted by the maintainers and the maintained system has to be paid by users. Often leads to recurring payments for the hosted system, auto-update, prioritized support, or disk usage.

Requires:
* Setup of a payment mechanism (self-build)
* Setup of a hosting platform (the SaaS)
* Setup of a legal entity to sell the premium version (incl. contracts, license(s), etc.)

Variants & Options:
* Monthly payments: Pay for usage per month or year
* Resource payments: Pay for the usage of resources (disk space, memore, cores, ...)
* Single-tenant: Each client has a dedicated system for himself
* Multi-tenant: One system is used by multiple clients
* API: Hosted versions of libraries as APIs (e.g., data processing, data aggregation, web scraping, etc.)

## Platforms
* N/A: Will require an individual hosting platform / website with possibility to pay and configure the system
* [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) (Payment of self-hosted APIs)
