# Monetization via Employment

Payment by getting hired from a company interested in the OSS - probably for business critical parts of their products. 
Employment might range from 100% to 20% work on the OSS. Employers might nudge the development into a direction that benefits them but hinders other companies / their competition. 
Often these are normal employments as on-site or remote developer but longer freelancing contracts are possible and generate mostly recurring income.

Requires:
* Either finding a company willing to hire or be approached by one
* Negotiation of an employment contract (esp. between different countries)

Variants & Options:
* Employment: Standard employment with social security contributions (country-specific)
* Freelancing: Commissioning by the company as a legal entity
